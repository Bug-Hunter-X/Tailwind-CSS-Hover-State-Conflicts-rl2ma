```javascript
// Example showing an incorrect use of Tailwind's hover pseudo-class
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover me!
</button>
// The problem occurs when there is another element with the same class as the hover class, causing unexpected styling.
<div class="bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  This element unintentionally gets the same styling as the hovered button
</div>
